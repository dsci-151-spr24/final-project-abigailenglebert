## Summary

##In this dataset we will be looking at how different movie trailers on youtube over the last couple of decades have impacted the success of the film themselves. The dataset I found was off of **https://www.kaggle.com**, and the data was collected by "CinemaFuture, a machine learning project focused on predicting the potential success of films." The tool searches for box office earnings, budgets, cast and crew information, genres, release dates, audience ratings, and social media trends, however in this specific dataset it scrapes YouTube comments from upcoming movies' trailers and conducts sentiment analysis to predict the success of the movie(s). The methods I used to answer my questions would be a code chunk showing the correlation between sentiment scores and box office performancet, then I used a bar graph showing the the ratios of opening weekend revenue to trailer views. I then used a code chunk to determine the number of sentiment scores.There seems to be strong link between higher box office receipts and sentiment scores that are favourable, however, it was also discovered that low sentiment scores had no appreciable influence on box office receipts. On the left side, we have movies with much less box office success than we would have expected based on their trailersâ€™ online performances. On the right side, we have movies that sold more tickets than their slighter YouTube numbers would have predicted. Most movies fall somewhere in the middle, with 59 percent. The average film that had trailers YouTube had a postive sentiment score of 87,153, while the other had a negative score of 42,413. The movies that had a more neutral score had 76,248.In conclusion, films that have a trailer on youtube, tend to be more sucessful.##
